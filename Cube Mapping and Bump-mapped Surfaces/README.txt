In this project, I implemented cube-mapping to create the seaside scenery that this surface would reflect/refract. I also implemented the sinc function to create more variation in the surface so that the reflection is more distinguished. I also used bump mapping to make the normals more scattered as the noise frequency and amplitude are increased.

This project was so much fun to do, combining bump-mapping, displacement mapping, reflection, and refraction all together. It was difficult to figure out how to do both reflection and refraction, but in the end, allowing the user to mix the two was the most effective way to go!
