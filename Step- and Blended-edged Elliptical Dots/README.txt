This project works with shaders, where I alter the pattern of an object. What is neat about this project is that with GLman, the user interface that I am using as a placeholder for the C++ code, the user can import different OBJ files to apply this texture to different objects, whether it be a bunny, a teapot, a cow, etc!

This first iteration works with ellipses and blur. The user is able to change the size of the ellipses in both the s and t direction. The user can also change the mix value, or the "blurring" amount around the edges of the ellipses. Pretty cool!
